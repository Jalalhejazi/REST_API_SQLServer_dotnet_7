# Feature: Streamline Development Workflow Using Docker

## Background:
Given a developer who wants to focus only on coding

## Scenario: Initialize a Development Environment
- Given the developer has Docker installed on their machine
- When the developer runs the command `docker-compose up`
- Then a Docker container should be initiated
- And the development environment should be set up within the container

## Scenario: Pull Existing Docker Images
- Given the developer has a Dockerfile that specifies an existing image
- When the developer runs the command `docker pull <image_name>`
- Then the Docker image should be pulled from the repository
- And it should be available locally for use

## Scenario: Code Without Worrying About Infrastructure
- Given the developer has initiated a Docker container
- And the development environment is set up in the container
- When the developer writes and tests code within the container
- Then the developer should not encounter environment-related issues
- And should be able to focus solely on coding

## Scenario: Tear Down Development Environment
- Given the developer has finished their coding tasks for the day
- When the developer runs the command `docker-compose down`
- Then the Docker container should be terminated
- And the local machine resources should be freed
